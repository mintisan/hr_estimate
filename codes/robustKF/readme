Data files:

Qoff.data         : Matlab data file consisting of orientation
                    data from LittleDog, in quarternion form

Matlab source code:

run_kf_test.m     : Test file to run the various Kalman filters on
                    Qoff.data

kf_prop.m         : Implements the propagation step of the Kalman filter
kf_update.m       : Implements the update step of the Kalman filter

hackedwKF_learn.m : Implements the "hacked" weighted Kalman filter,
                    as described in Ting et al., 2007

wrKF_learn.m      : Implements the weighted outlier-robust Kalman
                    filter

kf_update_learn.m : Implements the update step of the Kalman filter
                    except it performs an additional thresholding
                    step to check if the Mahalanobis distance of
                    the current data sample exceeds the theshold
                    (if it does, the data sample is considered an
                    outlier and no update is done). Additionally,
                    the system dynamics are learnt using a
                    maximum-likelihood framework.

Comments:

Run run_kf_test.m to compare all Kalman filters on the data. 
The indicator variables can be toggled on or off, depending on
which filters the user wants to run.

Please refer to the technical report by Ting, Theodorou & Schaal (2007)
(TR-CLMC-2007-1) for more details.
